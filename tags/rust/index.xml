With interpreted languages like JavaScript or Python this can be relatively easy as the runtime itself is able to execute arbitrary instructions without them having to be compiled first. Rust is a compiled lanaguage so does not have a method of executing abritrary instructions prior to compilation so adding functions generally requires rewriting them in Rust and redeploying the binary.</description></item></channel></rss>
