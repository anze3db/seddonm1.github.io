An example would be that a claim could hold a user claim role like administrator that if proven to be unaltered (using a shared public key) then could be used to provide access to certain administrator functions.
Tools like PostgREST, Hasura and Supabase (a managed PostgREST) rely on JWTs to carry a user&amp;rsquo;s claims where the role claim is used to set a Postgres role to enforce role-based access control.</description></item></channel></rss>
